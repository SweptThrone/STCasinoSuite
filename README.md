# STCasinoSuite

### HEAD'S UP
This addon is very old, and may be very bad.  Use it if you like, but don't expect perfection!

### What is it?
STCasinoSuite is a complete casino system for Garry's Mod DarkRP.  Coming packed with everything you could need to run a casino, including loans and ATMs, STCasinoSuite is sure to satisfy.

### How do I use it?
Download the whole thing and put the STCasinoSuite folder into your addons folder.  Poke around the stcasino_config.lua file and change that how you want.  Spawn whichever entities you want onto your map and enjoy!

### What can I do with it?
I'm not gonna officially stick a license on it because I don't care that much, but you can modify it however you want, but please do not post reuploads on the workshop.  I took a lot of time and sanity checking making this, and there's no reason to reupload it anyway.  If you want a new feature or something, just let me know or make a pull or fork or something, I don't know how this works.

### Is there a workshop version?
Yes!  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1373580329 has the exact same features as this one, even the config file!

### How do I run the lottery?
Someone recognized as an admin must type .lotto or .lottery in the chat.

### Quick feature list:
A coin flip simulator machine.  
A double or nothing machine.  
A time-based random number guessing machine.  
A slot machine with a jackpot.  
A normal slot machine.  
An ATM system, persisting through reconnects.  
A loan machine.  
A loan monitor.  
A very simple lotery machine.
